# SailfishOS:Chum and SailfishOS:Chum GUI icons
This README documents the "new icon(s)" for the [SailfishOS:Chum community repository](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum) and its [repository configuration RPM(s)](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/sailfishos-chum-repo-config), plus the [SailfishOS:Chum GUI application](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/sailfishos-chum-gui) and its [Installer](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/sailfishos-chum-gui-installer) created in Q1/2023 by [**\@Olf0** (olf)](https://github.com/Olf0).

### Variants of this icon
All available stages of the SVG icon and exported PNGs in various resolutions can be acessed in the [`.icon` directory of the SailfishOS:Chum GUI Installer](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/sailfishos-chum-gui-installer/tree/main/.icons):
- A preparatory SVG icon with both texts, "Chum" and "Chum GUI", the original text "CHUM" and font examples (all freely licensed) to [choose a font most closely to the original one](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/sailfishos-chum-gui/issues/132#issuecomment-1365622701): [`sailfishos-chum_combined.svg`](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/sailfishos-chum-gui-installer/blob/main/.icons/sailfishos-chum_combined.svg)<br />
  <sub>Ultimately the font "System-ui", which originally was a preliminary choice, was retained (due to a lack of input).</sub><br />
  <sup>Note that any element (e.g., text) can be easily switched invisible or deleted in any SVG editor.</sup>
- A "two in one" SVG icon with both texts, "Chum" and "Chum GUI": [`sailfishos-chum_combined_cleaned.svg`](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/sailfishos-chum-gui-installer/blob/main/.icons/sailfishos-chum_combined_cleaned.svg)<br />
  <sub>Note that either text can be easily switch invisible in any SVG editor to export PNG versions of either icon.</sub>
- Two SVG icons with only a single text retained for minimising the file sizes: [`sailfishos-chum.svg`](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/sailfishos-chum-gui-installer/blob/main/.icons/sailfishos-chum.svg) & [`sailfishos-chum-gui.svg`](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/sailfishos-chum-gui-installer/blob/main/.icons/sailfishos-chum-gui.svg)
- PNG exports of either icon on a square canvas in the classic SailfishOS icon sizes 86², 108², 128² and 172², plus 256², 480² and 560² (all sizes in pixel²).
- The subdirectories `86x86`, `108x108`, `128x128`, `172x172`, `256x256`, `480x480` and `560x560`, each containing two PNGs named `sailfishos-chum.png` and `sailfishos-chum-gui.png` in the corresponding size.
- The subdirectory `social-media`, containing the aforementioned 560² pixel² bitmap icons on a 792² pixel² canvas (√2 × 560 = 792, so it completely fits in a round cutting, when scaled before that, as e.g. GitHub.com and Transifex.com do at various places), on a 960×640 pixel² canvas (aspect ratio 3:2), on a 1280×640 pixel² canvas (aspect ratio 2:1, GitHub's recommended size for its social media icon in the repository settings), plus the 480² pixel² bitmap icons on a 1500×500 pixel² canvas (aspect ratio 3:1, as required by, e.g., Mastodon and Twitter), all as PNGs.
- In the top level `.icon` directory also variants of the SVG icons with an appended minus character "`-`" exist: These adhere to Jolla's guidline not to fully use the 86x86 pixel² canvas, but to leave a 0,3 pixel empty border; IMO this is not advantageous, see [here for details and why they are still kept](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/sailfishos-chum-gui-installer/pull/22#issue-1635512687).

### This icon in sibling repositories
The icon directories of the [SailfishOS:Chum GUI application](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/sailfishos-chum-gui/tree/main/icons) and the [SailfishOS:Chum community repository configuration RPM(s)](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/sailfishos-chum-repo-config/tree/main/.icons) contain a corresponding subset of the one of the [SailfishOS:Chum GUI Installer](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/sailfishos-chum-gui-installer/tree/main/.icons): The specific SVGs, which only contain either the text "Chum GUI" or "Chum" and the corresponding, exported PNGs are omitted.
